# FantasticHUD

Once you download the HUD, there will be two files,
the one will have "4x3" in brackets and the other will have "16x9"
thses are for the aspect ratios, just drag and drop the one in
your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom"
folder then your set (:

If the HUD looks wierd try the other file.

I don't know if this HUD will work on MacOS, or Linux, so try at your own risk.

If you have any issues or suggsetions for changes you can message me with
